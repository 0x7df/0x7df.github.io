Consider a concentration of *C*, in atoms per litre. This is constant in
space and time. The measured half-life is *τ*, in seconds, and the decay
constant is $ \lambda = \ln(2)/\\tau$. The
number of decays per second per litre – the decay rate – is *λC*.

However, this is an average value, and the decay is a Poissonian
process. The probability of *k* decays per litre in any given
second-long period is:

$$ p(k) = \frac{\left[\lambda k\right]^k e^{-\left[\lambda
C\right]}}{k!} $$

The figure shows example Poisson distributions for *λC* = 10, 50, 90 and
130.
