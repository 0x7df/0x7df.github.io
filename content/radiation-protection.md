Dose and Units
--------------

*Dose* is the amount of energy absorbed per unit mass, usually measured
in J/kg. There are two measures, however:

-   *Absorbed dose* is the energy deposited the medium, irrespective of
    the type of radiation and the nature of the medium. This is not a
    good measure of the biological effects of ionising radiation on
    living tissue, since different types of radiation cause different
    amounts of damage for the same energy deposited. The type of tissue
    also makes a difference.
-   *Dose equivalent* is therefore also used. This is the absorbed dose
    multiplied by a dimensionless quality factor (which is a function of
    the type of radiation), and another dimensionless number depending
    on the type of tissue, which together make up a radiation weighting
    factor. X-rays, gamma rays, electrons, positrons and muons have a
    quality factor of 1, protons 2, neutrons 5-20 depending on their
    energy, and alpha particles, heavy nuclei and fission fragments 20.
    The dose equivalent is also measured in J/kg, since the radiation
    weighting factor is dimensionless.

Because of the confusion arising from measuring both quantities in J/kg,
the units *gray* (Gy) and *sievert* (Sv) are used for absorbed dose and
dose equivalent, respectively.

Typical values
--------------

-   The average dose equivalent from natural background radiation is
    about 2 mSv/year.
-   For full-body doses received in a short period (up to about an
    hour):
    -   1 Sv causes nausea
    -   2-5 Sv causes hair loss, haemorrhaging and death in many cases
    -   3 Sv causes death within three days in 50% of cases
    -   6 Sv causes death in almost all cases

Risk vs. Dose
-------------

The broad view is that the relationship between risk and dose is more or
less linear down to as low as 100 mSv. However, there is controversy
over whether this relationship is linear at very low doses, or whether
there is some threshold dose below which the radiation causes no harm,
or even is beneficial. Statistical studies are reaching their limits due
to the size of populations required to demonstrate statistically
significant risk at lower exposure levels.
