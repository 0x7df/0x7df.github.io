Synchrotrons
------------

A synchrotron is a hard X-ray source. Electrons travel at near-light
speed around a large (e.g. 0.8 km-radius) underground storage ring.
X-rays are focused down to sub-micron-diameter beams for use in a very
wide range of experiments in X-ray imagine, spectroscopy and
diffraction.

Diffraction-limited performance.
