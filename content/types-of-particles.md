## Fermions

Half-integer spin

## Bosons

Integer spin

## Hadrons

All particles that undergo strong interactions, being composed of quarks (and
gluons). Includes baryons, hyperons and mesons. Hadrons can be bosons or
fermions.

## Leptons

All particles that do not experience the strong interaction. Includes
electrons, muons, tau particles, and their associated neutrinos. Leptons are
always fermions.

# Partons

Constituents of hadrons (quarks, anitquarks and gluons).

## Valence quarks

The constituent quarks and antiquarks that determine the external properties of
the hadron.

## Sea quarks

Quark-antiquark pairs contained in every hadron as well as valence quarks

## Baryon

A form of hadron which is also a fermion. (Hadrons that are bosons are mesons.)

## Colourless hadron

All obervable hadrons are colour singlets.

## Colour singlet

A state that is a combination of colours such that the total colour effect is
zero is said to be colourless.

## Charmonium

Symbol - ch. Bound state of $c\bar c$ (charmed quark - charmed anti-quark).
