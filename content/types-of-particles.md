## Fermions

Half-integer spin

## Bosons

Integer spin

## Hadrons

All particles that undergo strong interactions, being composed of quarks (and
gluons). Includes baryons (e.g. protons and neutrons), hyperons and mesons. Hadrons can be bosons or fermions.

## Leptons

All particles that do not experience the strong interaction. Includes
electrons, muons, tau particles, and their associated neutrinos. Leptons are
always fermions.

# Partons

Constituents of hadrons (quarks, anitquarks and gluons).

## Valence quarks

The constituent quarks and antiquarks that determine the external properties of
the hadron.

## Sea quarks

Quark-antiquark pairs contained in every hadron as well as valence quarks

## Baryon

A form of hadron (formed of quarks, undergoes strong interactions), which is
also a fermion. (Hadrons that are bosons are mesons.)

p = uud
n = udd

where u = up quark, d = down quark.

q[u] = +2/3 e
q[d] = -1/3 e

## Colourless hadron

All obervable hadrons are colour singlets.

## Colour singlet

A state that is a combination of colours such that the total colour effect is
zero is said to be colourless.

## Charmonium

Symbol - ch. Bound state of $c\bar c$ (charmed quark - charmed anti-quark).

## Quarks

Constituents of hadrons.

Three families: (u, d), (c, s) and (t, b), where u, d, c, s, t, b = "up",
"down", "charmed", "strange", "top" and "bottom". All have baryon number $B =
1/2$. Charges:

q[u, c, t] = +2/3 e
q[d, s, b] = -1/3 e

Each quark has its own antiquark, with opposite charge.

Pointlike.

Fermionic (spin angular momentum $s = 1/2$)

Each comes in three different colours: red, blue and green.

Colour is the source of the strong force field in the same way that charge is
the source of the electric field.
