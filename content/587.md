Plankc (1900) postulated discrete quanta of energy \epsilon_0,
2\epsilon_0, 3\epsilon_0, etc.

For mean energy, replacing integrals by sums

\bar\epsilon = \sum_{n=0}^\infty {n\epsilon_0 \exp{-\beta
n\epsilon_0}} / \sum_{n=0}^\infty {\exp{-\beta n\epsilon_0}}

= \epsilon_0 / (\exp{\beta\epsilon_0} - 1)

Substitute for \bar\epsilon as before, and for consistency with Wien's
displacement law \epsilon_0 = h\nu

E_\nu = (8\pi\nu^2/c^3)(1 / (\exp{h\nu/kT} - 1))

Planck's hypothesis superbly successful but still part classical, part
quantum...

1924 Bose-Einstein statistics
-----------------------------

Corpuscular approach, light quanta energy h\nu, momentum h\nu/c...

If base on classical Boltzmann statistics, fails to derive Planck's law
(Born, Atomic Theory, ch.VIII)

Needs something else

Indistinguishability of light quanta, symmetric wave function

Bose-Einstein statistics based on number of distinguishable arrangements

Leads to Planck's formula (justfying \beta = 1/kT from thermodynamics)
