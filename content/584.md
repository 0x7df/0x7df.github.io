1893 - Wien's displacement law

Thermodynamic engine can show: energy density E_\lambda =
\lambda^{-5} F(\lambda T) (see Born, Atomic Physics, appendix XXXIII)

Consistent with experimental finding \lambda_{max} T = constant

Finally from thermodynamics, function F independent of special mechanism

Planck adopted linear harmonic oscillator of frequency \mu, mean energy
\bar(\\eps)

In equilibrium E_{\mu} = (8\pi\mu^2/c^3)\bar(\epsilon)

Classical statistics \bar(\epsilon) = kT

1900 Raylegh-Jeans law E_\mu = (8\pi\mu^2/c^3) kT

I.e. consistent with Wien's displacement law but \int d\mu diverges:
"ultra-violet cataastrophe".
