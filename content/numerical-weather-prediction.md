Lewis Fry Richardson first attempted numerical weather prediction, without the
aid of a computer, in 1922. The results were poor, and there was little
improvement in weather forecast accuracey over subequent decades, until the
advent of the computer.

Jule Gregory Charney at the Princeton Institute of Advanced Study headed John
von Neumann's Meteorology Prooject. In 1950 Charney's team first successfully
demonstrated NWP on the ENIAC machine at the US Army's Ballistic Research
Laboratory in Aberdeen, MD; their 24-hour forecast took 24 hours to generate.

By Spring 1952 the IAS had its own machine. On May 6, 1955, real-time daily
forecasts began to be produced on an IBM 701 machine.
 
The first developments in NWP in the 1950s used a one-level barotropic
atmosphere with geostrophic winds, and hence no convergence or divergence (Barry
and Chorley, 1998). Hence the movement of systems could be predicted, but not
changes in their intensity.

The latest techniques employ multi-level baroclinic models and include friction
and other effects; hence the basic mechanisms of cyclogenesis are provided for
(Barry and Chorley, 1998).
