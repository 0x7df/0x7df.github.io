Summary: 
Status: draft

1. Short-range - this is the reason behind the saturation of the nuclear force
(see below).
2. Spin-dependent
3. Charge-independent - isobaric nuclei (nuclei with the same mass number), of
which mirror nuclei are a special case (see below), have similar energy levels,
indicating charge-independence. This is a stronger, more general statement than
charge symmetry, below, which is a special case of it.
4. Charge-symmetric - mirror nuclei, which have opposite numbers of neutrons
and protons, have similar energy levels, indicating neutron-neutron and
proton-proton interactions have the same energy.
5. Exchange force - apparent 'backward' scattering peak in neutron-proton
elastic scattering
6. Strong - the fact that nuclear binding energies are high (of order MeV per
nucleon) despite Coulomb repulsion indicates this.
7. Saturated - the fact that the binding energy per nucleon is fairly constant
(7 - 9 MeV) indicates that the strong force is saturated. This means that the
total binding energy of the nucleus is proportional to the number of
constituents.

# Weak force

Responsible for beta decay. Short-range (i.e. only inside the nucleus).
Weak (hence lifetime of beta decay is long - typically 900 s as opposed to
$10^{-23}$ for strong force). Stronger only then gravitational force.
