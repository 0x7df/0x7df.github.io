The 500 hPa [geopotential]({filename}/geopotential.md) height anomaly
correlation is a key indicator of the skill of numerical weather prediction.

[Patterns of 500 hPa heights reveal short- and long-wave troughs and ridges.](
https://www.e-education.psu.edu/worldofweather/node/2031) Surface low
pressure tends to develop (or strengthen) to the east of 500 hPa short-wave
troughs, while surface high pressure tends to form (or strengthen) to the
east of 500 hPa short-wave ridges. 

The correlation is between the *observed* and *forecast* 500 hPa geopotential
height anomaly. A higher value is better, indicating a forecast that was closer
to the observed situation.

A correlation of 0.6 is considered to represent a useful forecast. For the ECMWF
model, forecasts fell below 0.6 at about 5.5 days in 1980, whereas by 2010 the
it did not fall below 0.6 until about 8.5 days - this represents an improvement
in skill by one day per decade. The forecast for which the value fall to 0.8
is approaching 6.5 days.
