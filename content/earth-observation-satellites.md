Status: draft

## Satellite classification

### Passive

* Scanning radiometers usually operate in thermal IR part of the spectrum.
* Microwave sounders and imagers measure in microwave part of the spectrum (similar to radar wavelengths).
* Both measure SST; IR measurements are much higher resolution, but are blocked by cloud; microwave measurements are not affected by cloud cover, but are lower resolution.

### Active

* Satellite radar is microwave wavelength
* Used for altimetry
