$$ ... \rightarrow e^- + ... $$
$\mu$ cause straight tracks
$e^+$, $e^-$ cause showers
Straight tracks seen predominantly $e^+$ and $e^-$ production violates ELN and
MLN muon neutrinos


# The need for the neutrino

If beta decay were a simple two-body decay process:

$$ A \rightarrow B + e^- $$

the electron would have a fixed energy:

$$ E = \left[ \frac{m_A^2 - \left(m_B^2 + m_e^2\right)}{2m_A}\right]c^2 $$

In fact the electrons emitted in beta decay have a continuous range of energies
up to some maximum. To explain this anomaly, Wolfgang Pauli postulated the
existence of a third particle which, according to the data, would have to have
a very small or no mass, and be weakly interacting and spin-$$\frac{1}{2}$$. 

The existence of the neutrino also accounts for the apparent non-conservation
of angular momentum in certain beta decays.

## The detection of the neutrino

Fermi postulated:

$$ \bar\nu + p \rightarrow e^+ + n $$

A nuclear reactor emits of order $10^7$ neutrinos (???). Neutrinos from a
reactor are incident on a water target with CdCl (???), surrounded by
scintillators. The neutrino-proton reaction above happens in the water, and the
water/cadmium mixture (???) effectively slows down and absorbs the neutrons:

$$ Cd^{113} + n \rightarrow Cd^{114} + 3\gamma $$

The gammas from positron annihilation are counted (a pair of 511 keV gammas per
annihilation). Initially:

2.14/hour with reactor off versus 2.55/hour with reactor on. Not conclusive.

After three years, 36/hour with reactor on.

Cross-section determined:

$$ \sigma \approx 11 \times 10^{-44} cm^2 $$

which agreed with the theoretical value calculated by Bethe.

# Antineutrino

$\nu^{e^-}$ or $\bar\nu$

Accompanies electrons

Right-handed (spin parallel to velocity)

# Neutrino

$\nu^{e^+}$ or $\nu$

Accompanies positrons

Left-handed (spin and velocity anti-parallel)

Both are chargeless, massless (nearly), fermions, spin angular momentum $s =
1/2$, no structure (point particles), no nucleon number, no magnetic dipole
moment.
