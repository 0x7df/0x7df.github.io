Types of fusion reactor
-----------------------

To achieve fusion, extremely high temperatures must be achieved so that
nuclei can overcome the repulsive Coulomb force that acts to keep them
apart, and as a result of the high temperatures the material - usually
deuterium or a deuterium-tritium mix - is in a plasma state. This gives
rise to the technological challenge of confining this hot plasma for
long enough for the fusion reaction to take place.

There are two main techniques for confining a plasma in a fusion
reactor:

1.  Magnetic confinement
2.  Inertial confinement

Magnetic confinement fusion
---------------------------

In magnetic confinement fusion the hot D-T plasma is confined within a
toroid by magnetic fields. A toroidal magnetic field (going the long way
round the toroid) is generated by external coils. A poloidal magnetic
field (going the short way round) is generated by an electric current
flowing through the plasma in the toroidal direction. The resultant
field is helical. The toroidal electric current is usually driven by a
toroidal electric field, induced by a transformer. The plasma is
initially heated by Ohmic heating due to its own plasma current, induced
by the primary transformer. However the plasma becomes less resistive as
its temperature rises, so this heating technique is limited. Further
heating is therefore provided by neutral beam injection. Temperature is
maintained by alpha particle emission from the fusion reactions. The
alpha particles maintain the plasma at a steady temperature (allowing
the neutrons to escape so that their energy can be harnessed). <span

fusion reaction the temperature must be around 10 keV (around 100
million Kelvin) for a density of 1020 m-3 (at which the plasma pressure

has more than doubled every two years since the first generation of
tokamaks in the late 1960s, a faster rate of progress than Moore's law
for the number of transistors that can fit on a piece of silicon, and
faster than the rate of increase in energy of particle accelerators,
which doubles roughly every three years.</span>Only the Tokamak Fusion
Test Reactor at Princeton and JET at Culham have used D-T; most
experience have involved deuterium only. Plasma-facing components must
withstand particle fluxes of up to 20 MW/m2 (almost a quarter of the
heat flux on the surface of the sun), corresponding to a surface
temperature of tens of thousands of degrees. Water cooling is used to
vent some of this heat. One of the main challenges for producing a
feasible fusion reactor is achieving steady-state operation. The main
reason pulsed rather than continuous operation is currently used is that
the usually copper magnetic field coils require a lot of electrical
energy to maintain the steady magnetic field. A fusion reactor will
require superconducting coils to operate continuously with low power
consumption. These must be cooled to 1.8 K by liquid helium. The
technology pioneered in the fusion programme (particularly at the Tore
Supra tokamak at Cadarache) has formed the basis of the cryogenic
systems of the LHC.

Inertial confinement
--------------------

### Conventional inertial-confinement fusion (ICF)

ICF involves imploding a capsule of fuel - the hot plasma is confined by
its own inertia for a time, until enough fusion energy has been
deposited to overcome this inertia and cause the pellet to disassemble.

### Fast ignition

Unlike conventional inertial confinement fusion (ICF), which uses the
same set of laser beams both to compress and to heat the fuel, ast
ignition uses a set of long-pulse lasers to compress the fuel and a
separate short-pulse laser to heat it.

There are three phases:

1.  A capsule is imploded as in conventional ICF to assemble a
    high-density fuel configuration.
2.  A hole is bored through the capsule corona composed of ablated
    material, as the critical density is pushed close to the
    high-density core of the capsule by the ponderomotive force
    associated with high-intensity laser light.
3.  The fuel is ignited by suprathermal electrons, produced in the
    high-intensity laser-plasma interactions, which then propagate from
    the critical density to this high-density core.

The technique is so-called because the fuel must absorb the heat from
the short pulse within 10 ps of the implosion.

Fast ignition does not rely on heating the fuel with a series of shock
waves, as ICF does, to create a small central 'hot spot'. Therefore:

-   The requirement for high precision in the uniformity of the laser
    beam and shape of the fuel pellet is avoided, allowing lower quality
    fabrication.
-   More fuel can be compressed for the same energy; fast ignition is
    about two to three times more efficient than conventional ICF.

Crucial to the success of fast ignition will be the ability to transfer
a large enough fraction of the energy from the short pulse to the fuel.
