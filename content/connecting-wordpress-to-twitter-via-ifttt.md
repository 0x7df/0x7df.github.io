It's possible to string together web services - like
[WordPress](https://wordpress.com), [Twitter](http://twitter.com),
[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com), [Gmail](https://www.gmail.com),
[Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com), [Evernote](https://evernote.com/),
etc. - using [*If This Then
That*](http://ifttt.com)*(*[*IFTTT*](http://ifttt.com)for short).

In IFTTT, you create *Recipes*, each of which consists of a *Trigger*,
and an *Action.* Whenever you do something that is a Trigger for one of
your Recipes (like publishing a new WordPress blog post for example),
then the associated Action (such as tweeting the link to the blog post)
is automatically performed for you.

I've added a pre-existing recipe to my IFTTT account that does exactly
that, and this blog entry is to test it.
