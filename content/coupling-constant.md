Status: draft

A number which is a measure of the strength of an interaction.

- $\alpha_{fs} = 1/137$ - electromagnetic
- $\alpha_s \approx 100\alpha$ (but energy-dependent) - strong
- $\alpha_w \approx 4\alpha$ - weak

$\alpha_w$ rises with energy, as does $\alpha_s$. The weakforce is weak only
because of the large mass of $W$ and $Z$ exchange bosons (approximately 80
GeV), so very short range.
